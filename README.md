# iron jobs

An application for sharing job postings with other Iron Yard students and graduates.

## How to run

Easy! First, clone the repo locally. Then install the dependencies with `npm install`.
Last thing: run it on the command line with `npm start`

## How to develop

### Client

The client is all written... but if you want to tweak it, just edit the files
in the `client/` directory. Note that you will need to run `sass` on the styles
in order to build the `style.css` file!

##Contributors
Server and database setup by Sara Basile & Mo Diakite.

##Project Specifications
Use MongoDB and a node-based server to provide a back end for a job posting website.
The website is able to post new job listings, retrieve a list of all available jobs,
find a single job by its unique ID, and delete a single job listing.

##Future Features
Site may expand to include a search function through which users may find a job
based on keyword input.
